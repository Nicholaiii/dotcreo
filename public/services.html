            <h3 class="label">WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Regardless of your industry or purpose, our design and development talent won't fail to find a remarkable solution for your online endeavours. We understand that the makings of a great website is not just built on clever code and 
                    design - we're marketers at heart too.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">How is it built?</h4>
                <p>
                    For all our custom website builds we create them entirely from the ground up. For websites that are <u>not</u> online stores selling physical or digital products, we choose to avoid using an integrated CMS such as Wix or Squarespace as this gives us full flexibility to create a truly memorable and functional digital product whilst keeping page load speed and development times to a minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For your website to be available on the World Wide Web, it needs to live on a computer which is constantly turned on and connected to the internet in order to receive the traffic requests and send your web pages to the client - this is called a server. Servers don't have screens and in most cases
                    reside in large datacenters owned by companies such as Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We would rent a portion of hardware in these datacenters and, with a bit of magic, enable your website to be available to the world.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">Hosting & management</h4>
                <p>Unless you're using an <u>integrated CMS</u> such as BigCommece, Shopify, Wix, or Squarespace then you will need programming and terminal knowledge to manage any server. We can manage and host this for you for a small annual fee, or if you
                    have the relative knowledge then a full handover is entirely possible.
                <h4 class="text-background">Design stage</h4>
                <p>Once we understand your project requirements, you can first expect a design proof of concept which you'll need to approve. This will allow us to streamline the development process and make you feel more at ease with the process as you will be 
                    able to see what your website will look like before we begin creating it.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">Development stage</h4>
                <p>
                    During this stage we'll be hard at work writing the code to create your new website. For best practises and security reasons, we will need your assistance to create new accounts for certain softwares, access any domains, and integrate any marketing initiatives.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">Getting started</h4>
                <p>
                    As with any project, it's important to have an in-depth understanding in order to maximise success. Please book in <button class="purple-link open-modal">here</button> for a friendly 60 minute consultation - we'll have a chat and find the best solution to create your dream website.

            <h3 class="label">E-COMMERCE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    For all intents and purposes, an online store is more than just a website. It's the face and many moving arms of a company all co-existing in a constantly evolving digital landscape whereby the conversion event now becomes a transactional value. Whilst the principle is the same, many more factors come into play when creating a highly converting eCommerce website - and we're aware of that.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">How does it work?</h4>
                <p>It's imperative that any eCommerce store not only drives revenue on the front-end, but also saves time, automates business processes, and consolidates data on the back-end. To build our ideal representation of this we will require more than one thorough discussion to accumalate
                    a big enough insight into what is the best route in order to achieve this goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst ground up development of eCommerce websites is possible, it's just not justifiable when integrated CMS platforms such as BigCommerce or Shopify are available - we'll only use them in our eCommerce builds. They take all the heavy lifting (<em>you would'nt even believe!</em>) out of the equation for a fraction of the cost 
                    and allow you, an online eCommerce store owner, to concentrate on what matters. However, a large amount of custom development is still required on the front-end to achieve proper functionality and aesthetics, as the native templates and functions are subpar.  
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">What will I receive?</h4>
                <p>
                    The platforms from which we will use to build your online store are quite remarkable. After we're finished with our design and development magic dust you will receive a robust, scalable, and revenue-driven eCommerce website with all the appropriate tools and interfaces you need to grow your business compiled into a seamless and user-friendly dashboard.
                    From here you'll be able to manage all of your products, prices, orders, analytics, and a cosmos of other helpful integrations. There's even a <em>drag and drop</em> website builder which will allow you to make minor changes to your website without writing any code.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">The first step</h4>
                <p>
                    To own your own online store is an amazing feat, and we'd love to help you achieve this in all it's glory. Please book in for a free consultation <button class="purple-link open-modal">here</button> where we can discuss your project and talk all things eCommerce.

        <div class="contentBx">
            <h3 class="label">UI/UX OVERHAUL</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    If you've already got a working website, but you're not happy with the functionality or aesthetic you currently have, then a UI/UX overhaul <em>might</em> be the cheaper and more efficient option for you.
                    Aside from preference, it's important to understand more about the workings of your business and discuss any data you may have already (qualitative and quantitative), as a holistic approach is needed to fully understand 
                    how we can not only improve the UI/UX but move the needle in your business as a result.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">What is UI/UX?</h4>
                <p>
                    The acronym UI pertains to the <em>user interface</em> of the website. This is the graphical portion of a website such as the layout, colours, spacing, branding etc. On the other hand, the acronym UX would pertain to the <em>user experience</em>; think of this as how a user
                    experiences a website relative to matters such as utility, easy of use, and efficiency.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">What can we do?</h4>
                <p>
                    As part of our design promise we're confident that regardless of whatever style you're looking for - we can make it. If design isn't your thing, then you can always rely on us to conceptualise it for you for no extra cost. In terms of utility and functionality,
                    it may be the case that you're looking to optimise business processes not only on the front-end, but on the back-end; in this case we can help you to integrate anything from complex booking systems to simple tracking pixels and analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important aspect of any website development, partial or full, is that the finished outcome improves the trajectory of the business. We'll take a look at everything on the table, discuss with you any design preferences, and 
                    create a tailored approach just for your business. It's important to note that if the current source code of the website is old and clunky, sometimes a UI/UX overhaul is not a viable option, and a new website build is needed for a business to flourish online.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-background">The next step</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you're all booked in for a free consultation <button class="purple-link open-modal">here</button>, you can expect a friendly and thorough discussion whereby we become accustomed and discuss your project requirements.
